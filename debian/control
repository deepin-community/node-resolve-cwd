Description: Resolve the path of a module from current directory
 This module can be used to determine the path of a module starting from the
 current working directory.
 .
 For an input of moduleId to resolveCwd(moduleId), it gives an error when the
 module can't be found, which is similar to how require() works.
 .
 If moduleId is called as resolveCwd.silent(moduleId) then it returns null
 instead of giving an error when the module can't be found.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
